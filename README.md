# Fast-SNARF: A Fast and Universal Deformer for Articulated Neural Volumetric Representations

<img src="assets/teaser.gif" /> 


This repo will contain the code for our new project *Fast-SNARF:A Fast and Universal Deformer for Articulated Neural Volumetric Representations*. 

Fast-SNARF models the articulation of neural volumetric representations, such as NeRF and occupancy field. It allows learning avatars from a monocular video or 4D scans in an accurate and fast way, as illustrated in the video above. In particular, Fast-SNARF achieves similar accuracy as its parent [SNARF](https://github.com/xuchen-ethz/SNARF) while being 150x faster. We will release our paper and code very soon - ideally next week. Stay tuned!
